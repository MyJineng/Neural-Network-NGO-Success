# Neural-Network-NGO-Success

## Background
Neural Networks are great for revealing hidden patterns, especially in complex data sets that don't have a disitnct relationship.
Synthetic data on NGO campaigns was used to predict which campaigns would be most successful and efficitently allocate funds.
The goal was to predict with over a 75% accuracy of wether a campgain would be successful or fail.

## Setup
Data was preprocessed by dropping categories that did not provide insight such as the name and organization id
The data was then scaled to reduce distorions of categories with larger magnitudes. 
The target variable was declared to be IS_SUCCESSFUL, which was whether past campaigns were successful
