# Neural-Network-NGO-Success

## Background
Neural Networks are great for revealing hidden patterns, especially in complex data sets that don't have a disitnct relationship.
Synthetic data on NGO campaigns was used to predict which campaigns would be most successful and efficitently allocate funds.
The goal was to predict with over a 75% accuracy of wether a campgain would be successful or fail.
